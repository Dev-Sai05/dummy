Customer Information data is continuously increasing with increasing banking customers.
Every day new requirement arises in the bank domain. Hence, effectively developing coding techniques, monitoring and documentation has been introduced.
 ----------------------------------------------------------

India’s largest bank in terms of volume of transactions and volume of accounts of individual customers.  This organization has a history for more than 200 years and has a wide range of products and facilities for customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

TCS is in relationship with the client from start of computerization of banking domain and has built many major projects and has gained achievements along with client.

Naga Sai Ganesh Athukuri has completed 4 years of experience in IT and currently working as senior developer, contributed in client project in Visual Cobol Microservices.
-> I developed a core banking microservices system built using Java → JVM COBOL → Native COBOL, deployed on Tomcat and running on Kubernetes.
My design involves:
-> Two databases: Day DB and Night/Ref DB, switching based on RE codes.
-> Java connects to DBs and passes the day-DB connection down to native COBOL, where it stays open till the service stops.
-> Java handles parallel processing using Fork/Join to split large inputs (like 100 account numbers) and call COBOL in multiple parallel tasks.
- > Native COBOL is single-threaded, so parallel Java calls sometimes cause connection pool contention, thread blocking, and transaction failures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I’ve addressed the performance, scalability, and concurrency challenges across the Java → JVM COBOL → Native COBOL architecture, the following solution was implemented:
 Stabilized the Java–COBOL Interaction Layer:
 Introduced controlled parallelism from Java, instead of allowing uncontrolled Fork/Join parallel tasks to bombard COBOL, a thread-safe execution gateway was implemented so that Java still performs parallel processing, but COBOL is called in a sequential, controlled, and non-overlapping manner, preventing DB contention and COBOL-level crashes.
This ensured that the native COBOL modules—which are single-threaded—receive requests at a sustainable rate.
------------------------------------------------
I’ve implemented solution delivered significant technical, operational, and business-level advantages to the client’s core banking platform.
1.	Improved System Stability Under High Load.
2.	Higher Throughput & Better TPS.
3.	Reduced Database Connection Failures.
4.	Faster Batch Completion & Fewer Night-Mode Incidents.
5.	Improved Scalability Across Microservices.
6.	Enhanced Observability and Faster Troubleshooting.
7.	More Consistent and Flexible Response Handling.
8.	Future-Ready Architecture.
--------------------------------------------------
The client appreciated the improvements delivered to their core banking microservices platform and acknowledged the impact across performance, stability, and operational efficiency.
